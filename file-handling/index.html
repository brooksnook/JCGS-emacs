<h1>File-handling elisp</h1>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="buffer-file-sync.el">buffer-file-sync.el</a>
  <dd> Make sure that buffers match the file contents. Useful for
      catching up with changes made outside emacs (or by another emacs).

  <dt> <a href="copy-directory.el">copy-directory.el</a>
  <dd> Copy the files in a directory, copying only those that were not
      there already.
      
  <dt> <a href="filename-cases.el">filename-cases.el</a>
  <dd> Try to fix up filename cases (when spoilt by case-insensitive OSes)
      
  <dt> <a href="filenames-in-buffers.el">filenames-in-buffers.el</a>
  <dd> Find the file whose name point is on, and other things like that.

  <dt> <a href="filenames-in-env.el">filenames-in-env.el</a>
  <dd> Put environment variables into filenames where possible.
      For a given set of environment variable names, this puts
      $VARIABLE into the filename string -- the converse of
      <code>substitute-in-file-name</code>.

  <dt> <a href="common-directory.el">common-directory.el</a>
  <dd> Special handling of files in a directory named by the
      environment variable <code>COMMON</code>. This is the directory
      that I shuttle between my machines, using a USB key. I put some
      advice on the functions for renaming and deleting files, so the
      other machines don't re-instate them. Also contains code for
      spotting and deleting the "Copy of" files that Windows' copy
      programs sometimes make (at least, I think that's what makes them).
      
  <dt> <a href="filenames-under-tags.el">filenames-under-tags.el</a>
  <dd> Find a file of a given short name (last part of name) amongst
      directories for which you have tag files. (Can be useful in
      picking through compiler output when not enough of the pathname
      is given.)

  <dt> <a href="file-name-insertions.el">file-name-insertions.el</a>
  <dd> Insert the name of the file in the other window, etc (often
      useful in shell buffers)

  <dt> <a href="multi-find-file.el">multi-find-file.el</a>
  <dd> Find multiple files in one command.

  <dt> <a href="pseudo-grep.el">pseudo-grep.el</a>
  <dd> Does something a bit like grep, but entirely within emacs.
      
  <dt> <a href="removable-media.el">removable-media.el</a>
  <dd> Intended for use with USB storage devices with WinEmacs, where
      a file may appear on different drives on different
      occasions.

  <dt> <a href="with-file.el">with-file.el</a>
  <dd> Perform an operation on a file, killing the buffer afterwards
      if it was not being visited before, and doing other similar
      tidying-up.
