<h1>Editing</h1>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="odf-mode.el">odf-mode.el</a>
  <dd> Major mode for reading, and possibly editing, Open Document Format files.

  <dt> <a href="delatex.el">delatex.el</a>
  <dd> Expand and remove LaTeXery from a file.

  <dt> <a href="diary-mode.el">diary-mode.el</a> <!-- checked -->
  <dd> Simple major mode for editing diary files, with colouring by
      day of week.

  <dt> <a href="dwim-find.el">dwim-find.el</a>
  <dd> Find the thing at point, making guesses as to whether it's a
      filename, a function or whatever.

  <dt> <a href="edit-tree.el">edit-tree.el</a> <!-- checked -->
  <dd> Apply a command to all files in a directory tree. Goes nicely
      with <a href="replace-regexp-list.el">replace-regexp-list.el</a>
      which is also in this directory.

  <dt> <a href="generic-text.el">generic-text.el</a> <!-- checked -->
  <dd> Some generic text commands (needing modal-functions.el from
      <a href="http://emacs-versor.sourceforge.net/">emacs-versor</a>) for inserting markup. The same commands are
      defined for HTML, TeX, LaTeX etc. They provide similar
      facilities to <a
      href="http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/tools/">html-helper-mode</a>
      but consistently across several markup-language modes. I should
      probably re-write this to integrate with <a
      href="http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/">AUCTeX</a>.

      <p>It also needs <a
      href="gentext-models.el">gentext-models.el</a> and <a
      href="gentext-bindings.el">gentext-bindings.el</a>, and the
      following mode-specific definition files:</p>

      <dl>

	<dt> <a href="gentext-html.el">gentext-html.el</a>
	<dd> HTML definitions for generic-text.el; they build on <a
	    href="http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/tools/">html-helper-mode</a>

	<dt> <a href="gentext-tex.el">gentext-tex.el</a>
	<dd> TeX and LaTeX definitions for generic-text.el. Should add
	    TeXinfo some time too.

	<dt> <a href="gentext-tex.el">gentext-texinfo.el</a>
	<dd> TeXinfo definitions for generic-text.el.

	<dt> <a href="gentext-roff.el">gentext-roff.el</a>
	<dd> groff/nroff/troff definitions for generic-text.el -- not yet written

	<dt> <a href="gentext-plaintext.el">gentext-plaintext.el</a>
	<dd> Plaintext definitions for generic-text.el -- not yet written

      </dl>

  <dt> <a href="goto-char-other-window.el">goto-char-other-window.el</a>
  <dd> Take the number at point, and jump to that place in the other window.

  <dt> <a href="hyphenate.el">hyphenate.el</a>
  <dd> Hyphenate words before and after point. A fairly trivial
      function, but giving it a name makes it a lot easier when using the
      voice interface.

  <dt> <a href="replace-regexp-list.el">replace-regexp-list.el</a> <!-- checked -->
  <dd> Do all replacements in a list. Goes nicely with <a
      href="edit-tree.el">edit-tree.el</a> which is also in this
      directory. You might also like to see <a
      href="http://www.wonderworks.com/download/mapreplace.el">http://www.wonderworks.com/download/mapreplace.el</a>,
      which I think is probably by Kyle Jones (going by where it is stored).

  <dt> <a href="skip-initial-comments.el">skip-initial-comments</a> <!-- checked -->
  <dd> Set up find-file-hooks so that when you visit a file, point is
      positioned at the first non-comment in the file. After all,
      that's often what I first do by hand, if not looking
      specifically for a point further down, so might as well automate
      it.

  <dt> <a href="compare-windows-interactively.el">compare-windows-interactively.el</a>
  <dd> A difference browser, in the form of a command loop that calls
      compare-windows repeatedly, letting you make adjustments (moving
      point in one window or the other) each time it finds a
      difference.

  <dt> <a href="insertions.el">insertions.el</a>
  <dd> Insert things in the current buffer.

  <dt> <a href="ps-stack-comments.el">ps-stack-comments.el</a>
  <dd> Update stack comments in a PostScript file

  <dt> <a href="electric-space.el">electric-space.el</a>
  <dd> Electric handling of the space key, which avoids putting in the
      space when Dragon sends one when you don't really want it, such
      as just inside an open-bracket or an open-quote.

  <dt> <a href="strfile.el">strfile.el</a>
  <dd> Simple major mode for ``fortune'' source files.

  <dt> <a href="structure-edit.el">structure-edit.el</a>
  <dd> Some simple structured editing -- remember a place, wander
      round to pick something up (in a recursive edit), and yank it at
      the remembered place.

  <dt> <a href="unique.el">unique.el</a>
  <dd> Remove duplicate successive lines in a region, like the Un*x
      "uniq" utility.

  <dt> <a href="yank-menu.el">yank-menu.el</a>
  <dd> Inspired by browse-yank.el -- this package pops up a menu
      buffer containing the contents of the kill ring, with one entry
      per line. If you have a large kill ring, and save it between
      sessions, you can find a lot of useful stuff in it this way!
      I've meant to tidy this up a bit, for years now, but keep on
      finding it usable as it is.

  <dt> <a href="yank-whitespace.el">yank-whitespace.el</a>
  <dd> Modify (``advise'') kill and yank (cut and paste) functions, to
      remember the neighbouring whitespace status of things moved
      around, so that if, for example, you yank something that, when
      killed or saved, had been at the start of a line, it gets a
      newline put in ``intelligently''.
