JCGS-emacs
==========

My emacs directory.

I've been using GNU Emacs since around 1987, and my configuration has
gone through several major revisions since then (and is now older than
a lot of fresh PhD graduates).  This time round, I'm putting it under
version control, and into github as Dropbox is seen as a security risk
in my latest job.  (I'm less keen on Dropbox now anyway --- see
http://www.drop-dropbox.com/)

For a couple of decades now, it's been based on a load-directory
function I wrote, with a directory of pieces.
