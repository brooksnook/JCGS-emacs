<h1>my-extensions-to-packages/voice</h1>

<p>This directory mostly contains adaptors to fit existing code into the
voice system. These provide lists of command names which are to be
voice-enabled.  There is also some code for recognising command
phrases embedded in dictation. </p>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="cachepad-preload.el">cachepad-preload.el</a>
  <dd> Preload the <a href="">cachepad</a> with words from the region. 

  <dt> <a href="command-phrases.el">command-phrases.el</a>
  <dd> Support for embedded-commands.el, managing a tree of words
      Which make up phrases to be recognised as commands embedded in dictation. 

  <dt> <a href="dired-voice.el">dired-voice.el</a>
  <dd> Voice commands for dired. 

  <dt> <a href="emacs-lisp-voice.el">emacs-lisp-voice.el</a>
  <dd> Voice commands for editing Emacs lisp. 

  <dt> <a href="embedded-commands.el">embedded-commands.el</a>
  <dd> This recognises command phrases embedded in dictation. 

  <dt> <a href="flexi-choose-voice.el">flexi-choose-voice.el</a>
  <dd> some extensions to my <a
      href="http://emacs-versor.sourceforge.net/">flexible chooser</a>
      system, for selecting choice tree nodes by line number, and for
      taking text added at the end of the mini buffer (for example, by
      speech) and using it to filter the current choice tree. This
      allows you to make choices from a list of computerish things
      without having to pronounce punctuation.  For example, to select
      ``flexi-choose-voice.el'' from a list of filenames, it would
      suffice to say ``choose'', producing a new choice tree
      containing only those elements of the old one which contain
      ``choose'', and, if that does not reduce it to a single file,
      then say ``voice'', which is likely to trim the tree to a single
      node -- all without having had to say `flexi'', ``-'', or
      ``.el''.

  <dt> <a href="general-voice.el">general-voice.el</a>
  <dd> Some general voice commands. 

  <dt> <a href="gentext-voice.el">gentext-voice.el</a>
  <dd> Voice commands for inserting markup constructs, using <a
      href="../../editing/generic-text.el">../../editing/generic-text.el</a>.
      
  <dt> <a href="insert-voice.el">insert-voice.el</a>
  <dd> Voice commands to insert various small textual things. for
      inserting larger textual things such as markup constructs, see
      gentext-voice.el.
      
  <dt> <a href="misc-voice.el">misc-voice.el</a>
  <dd> Some miscellaneous voice commands, that I would not really
      call ``general''. 
      
  <dt> <a href="prefix-voice.el">prefix-voice.el</a>
  <dd> Spoken forms of prefix arguments.  This doesn't work as I
      expected it to, at least in early forms of the voice system, as
      it replicates the first letter of the command, that is, it is
      taken as the prefix argument to the first self-insert-char of
      of entering M-x command. 

  <dt> <a href="spoken-forms.el">spoken-forms.el</a>
  <dd>At first, I put the spoken forms for all my new modules into the
      modules themselves, but that made me load of them to have spoken
      forms available, and as part of my move towards using autoload
      more, I have now gathered them here.

  <dt> <a href="type-break-voice.el">type-break-voice.el</a>
  <dd> Voice commands for type-break. 

  <dt> <a href="voice-assist-key.el">voice-assist-key.el</a>
  <dd> Commands to be reached from a key or pedal, for use in close
      connection with voice input.
      
  <dt> <a href="voice-command-generators.el">voice-command-generators.el</a>
  <dd> an attempt, currently put aside, at generating commands
      Automatically from keymaps. 

  <dt> <a href="voicescript.el">voicescript.el</a>
  <dd> The beginning of a voice-oriented scripting language. 

</dl>

<p><a href="../../editing/smart-space.el">smart-space.el</a> is also most useful with voice input.</p>
