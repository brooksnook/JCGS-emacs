<h1>Natural language handling</h1>

<p>I am a (very amateur) enthusiast about <a
href="http://www.cb1.com/~john/languages/index.html">natural
languages</a>, and have started to write some software related to this
interest. However, I'm not a computational linguist -- this is just at
a hobby level as far as the natural language side goes.</p>

<dl>
  <dt> <a name="mulvo"></a>mulvo.el

      This has become <a
      href="http://mulvoc.sourceforge.net/">MuLVoc</a> on SourceForge.
      
  <dt> <a href="localized-source.el">localized-source.el</a>
  <dd> Show localization for source files, e.g. translations of
      comments and perhaps names. Intended for (typically open-source)
      developers in countries where knowledge of English is not
      typically good; particularly where there may be large
      organizations who could have translators translating the
      comments on open-source code that their programmers then work
      on.

  <dt> <a href="csv-vocab-mode.el">csv-vocab-mode.el</a>
  <dd> Switches input modes according to which column of a spreadsheet
      point is in. This requires a special row of the spreadsheet to
      set up its input methods. Useful for entering data for use with
      mulvo. Builds on <a href="http://centaur.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Emacs/">csv-mode.el</a> by Francis J. Wright.

  <dt> <a href="pinyin-conversions.el">pinyin-conversions.el</a>
  <dd> Convert pinyin data coming in from files.
      
  <dt> <a href="words-in-elisp-symbols.el">words-in-elisp-symbols.el</a>
  <dd> List the words occurring in the symbols defined in the
      currently running emacs. Meant to give an idea of what to
      translate if preparing for emacs work using localized-source.el.
      
  <dt> <a href="language-codes.el">language-codes.el</a>
  <dd> Look up language codes, using the data from <a
      href="http://www.ethnologue.com/codes/LanguageCodes.tab">http://www.ethnologue.com/codes/LanguageCodes.tab</a> on <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/">Ethnologue</a>.
      
  <dt> <a href="wiktionary-swadesh.el">wiktionary-swadesh.el</a>
  <dd> Read a Swadesh list file from <a
      href="http://www.wiktionary.org/">Wiktionary</a>, and convert it
      into mulvo format data.

      <p>Here is an extract from <a
      href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Swadesh_List">wiktionary's
      description of the Swadesh List</a>:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
      The below list of words was devised by the linguist Morris Swadesh.
      He used it as a means of determining the closeness of any pair of
      languages. It is a useful list of the most common words, which are
      essential to most languages and may be used in learning basic
      communication in other languages and even multiple languages at once
      since, for basic communication, vocabulary is generally more useful
      than a knowledge of the target language syntax.  Sometimes it is even
      possible to learn basic communication with no knowledge of the target
      language syntax.
      </blockquote>

      <p>I think I'll have to produce a parts-of-speech table for the
      Swadesh list for myself, and will put it in my languages web
      pages when I've done it.</p>

  <dt> <a href="swadesh-numbers.el">swadesh-numbers.el</a>
  <dd> Add parts of speech to a Swadesh list.
      
  <dt> <a href="html-phrase-list.el">html-phrase-list.el</a>
  <dd> Read a phrase list, such as the one in <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_language">Basque
      language - Wikipedia</a>, and produce a CSV file from it, for
      mulvo to use.

  <dt> <a href="irish.el">irish.el</a>
  <dd> Support for the Irish (Gaelic) language. Modifies
      capitalization to understand uru (eclipsis).
      
  <dt> <a href="octal-chars.el">octal-chars.el</a>
  <dd> Convert escape sequences to the characters they represent.
